# dsa
This is a C++ program that demonstrates the implementation of a simple graph using an adjacency matrix. The program asks the user to input the number of cities, the names of those cities, and the cost of flights between the cities.
The program then prints the graph and performs a depth-first search to determine whether the graph is connected or not.

REQUIREMENTS:
To run this program, you need to have the following installed on your machine:
C++ compiler
Code editor or IDE

PROGRAM STRUCTURE:
The program is structured as follows:

The Graph class defines three member functions: readGraph(), printGraph(), and DFS().
The readGraph() function reads in the graph data from the user, including the number of cities, their names, and the cost of flights between them.
The printGraph() function prints out the graph in the form of an adjacency matrix, with city names as column and row headers.
The DFS() function performs a depth-first search on the graph to determine whether it is connected or not.
The main function creates an instance of the Graph class and calls its member functions to input, print, and analyze the graph data.
